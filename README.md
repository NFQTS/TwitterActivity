# TwitterActivity
Tracks mentions and retweets of NFT projects and founder accounts.

Things to note:
1.) You will need your own Twitter developer account to get access to their API. Applying for "Elevated access" is recommended.
2.) You will need to enter your Twitter developer "bearer token" in metaduelsv6.9.py
3.) I have inserted some delays just to prevent the API from getting spammed so you don't hit the rate limit, but I didn't put a lot of thought into it.
