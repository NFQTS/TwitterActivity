# TwitterActivity
Tracks mentions and retweets of NFT projects and founder accounts.

Things to note:
1.) You will need your own Twitter developer account to get access to their API. Applying for "Elevated access" is recommended.
2.) You will need to enter your Twitter developer "bearer token" in metaduelsv6.9.py
